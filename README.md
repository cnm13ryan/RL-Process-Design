# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Design/Synthesis of Chemical Engineering Processes

# Final year chemical engineering thesis by Laurence Midgley and Michael Thomson

## See Report pdf for details

A good starting point to get a basic idea of RL for process synthesis is the jupyter notebook https://github.com/lollcat/RL-Process-Design/blob/master/Discrete/PFR%20or%20CSTR/Agent.ipynb, which gives a simple illistrative example (read notebook in conjunction with PDF report).
