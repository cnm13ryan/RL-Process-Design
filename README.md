# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Design/Synthesis of Chemical Engineering Processes

# Final year chemical engineering thesis by Laurence Midgley and Michael Thomson

## See Report pdf for details

A good starting point to get a basic idea of RL for process synthesis is colab given at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1961Md6-7qUhWGBpr8LB7Q9xovD-UzKqw?usp=sharing, which gives a simple illistrative example.
